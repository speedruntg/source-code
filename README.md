# Speedrun: The Game
We are open-source video game created and maintained by [The Modding Community](https://moddingcommunity.com/). We are geared towards the speedrunning community and strive to provide tools for the community to utilize to create flavors, game modes, and maps for speedrunning!

We are developing an open-source timer/world record software for communities hosting servers under our game and also for external use! We support the Speedrun community and are giving the community power to create their own flavors/game modes and maps for speedrunning in general.
